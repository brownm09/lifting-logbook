# ─── OTel Collector sidecar config (#768) ────────────────────────────────────
#
# The collector's config.yaml is mounted into the otel-collector sidecar on the
# api service at /etc/otelcol/config.yaml. Cloud Run mounts config *files* from
# Secret Manager (there is no ConfigMap volume on Cloud Run), so the pipeline config
# lives in the Secret Manager secret `<name_prefix>-otel-collector-config`.
#
# That secret is intentionally NOT Terraform-managed. It is created and versioned by
# the api Cloud Run deploy step (.github/workflows/deploy.yml → "Deploy API + OTel
# Collector sidecar to Cloud Run") straight from the repo file
# infra/cloud-run/otel-collector-config.yaml, then mounted onto the injected sidecar by
# that same step. Three reasons, mirroring the OTel
# auth-header secrets handled out-of-band above in main.tf:
#   1. Declaring it here would 409 against the pipeline-created secret.
#   2. This service is lifecycle.ignore_changes = [template], so Terraform cannot
#      wire the sidecar onto the running revision anyway — the deploy step owns the
#      whole sidecar (containers, env, mounts), so the secret belongs with it.
#   3. The content is non-sensitive and fully derived from a repo file (no operator
#      token, unlike the Grafana auth headers), so CI can create + version it with no
#      human step; the pipeline adds a new version only when the file's content changes.
#
# No extra IAM: the sidecar runs as the api workload SA, which already holds a
# project-level roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor grant (gke.tf api_workload_roles),
# so it can read this secret and the two auth-header secrets with no per-secret binding.

# deliberate reversal of the original "API requires Cloud Run IAM auth" model
# (ADR-032): ADR-028 wires PUBLIC_API_URL to the API's external Cloud Run URL
# so browsers call it directly, which structurally cannot present a Cloud Run
# IAM identity token (CORS preflights never carry the app's auth headers) —
# see apps/web/lib/client-api.ts's "AUTH HEADER INVARIANT" comment. Without
# this grant, every client-side write (reschedule, skip/unskip, lift records,
# imports, ...) 403s at the Cloud Run front end before reaching the app.
#
# web_invoker_on_api is kept even though it's no longer strictly required for
# access — the web workload SA still presents a real GCP identity token on its
# server-to-server calls (X-Clerk-Authorization carries the Clerk JWT
# separately), which is harmless and gives that traffic a distinct IAM audit
# trail from anonymous callers.
