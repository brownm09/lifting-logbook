    Phase 1 of enabling the edge rate limit (#808 / ADR-034): provision the external
    HTTPS Application Load Balancer + Cloud Armor policy in front of the web Cloud Run
    service. Default false: the app serves directly off *.run.app and the entire stack
    (edge-load-balancer.tf) is count=0, so `terraform plan` is a no-op on the committed
    tfvars.

    Creating the LB REQUIRES var.web_domain (a managed cert cannot cover *.run.app) and
    a DNS cutover to the load balancer IP (output edge_lb_ip). It does NOT by itself lock
    down run.app — that is phase 2 (var.lock_web_ingress_to_lb), flipped only after the
    cert is ACTIVE, so enabling never causes downtime. See ADR-034 and docs/deploy.md for
    the two-phase enable procedure; tracked in #826 (the #804 collector wiring has landed,

    true (enforced by a precondition on the web service). Flip this ONLY after the LB is

    pointed at the LB IP during the cutover; like the apex, any pre-existing Cloud Run
