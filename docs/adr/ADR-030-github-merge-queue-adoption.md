# ADR-030: GitHub Merge Queue Adoption

**Status:** Accepted (Amended 2026-07-06; amended again 2026-07-22 — org transfer landed, merge queue live)
**Date:** 2026-07-05
**Closes:** [#673](https://github.com/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook/issues/673) (staged across [#694](https://github.com/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook/issues/694), [#695](https://github.com/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook/issues/695))
**Related:** [ADR-023](ADR-023-staging-integration-test-design.md) (the `Staging Integration Tests` required check this decision protects the throughput of)
**Unblocked by:** [#729](https://github.com/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook/issues/729) (transfer to an organization — discovered post-#694, not part of the originally planned two-PR staging; **completed 2026-07-22**, see the amendment immediately below)

> **Amendment (2026-07-22) — the eligibility blocker is resolved; merge queue is LIVE.** [#729](https://github.com/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook/issues/729) landed: this repository was transferred from the personal account `brownm09` to the **`merickvaughn` organization** (`owner.type: Organization`, confirmed live via `gh api repos/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook --jq .owner.type`). Merge queue is therefore eligible, and **"Require merge queue" is now enabled on `main`** — merge method **squash**, **Build Concurrency 1** (`maximumEntriesToBuild: 1`, the setting #695 specifies below to keep the shared staging deploy-mutex uncontended inside the queue), with `strict: true` retained. Live-validated by merging the migration PR ([#864](https://github.com/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook/pull/864)) through the queue, which closes #673, #695, and #729 together.

> **Scope of this amendment:** the 2026-07-06 amendment below and every "personal account" / "does not currently qualify" / "blocked on #729" statement in the Options, Rationale, and Consequences sections describes the **pre-transfer state (2026-07-05 → 2026-07-21)** and is retained as the historical record. Those statements are no longer true of this repository. The underlying decision (adopt merge queue) is unchanged — it is now simply in force rather than blocked.

> **Amendment (2026-07-06) — superseded by the 2026-07-22 amendment above; describes the pre-transfer state.** The original Decision/Rationale below assumed public repo visibility alone was sufficient for merge queue eligibility. That assumption was **wrong** — merge queue requires the repository be **owned by an organization**, regardless of visibility. As of this amendment the repo was `brownm09/lifting-logbook`, owned by a personal user account (`owner.type: User`), confirmed live at the time via `gh api repos/brownm09/lifting-logbook`. This blocked #695 until [#729](https://github.com/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook/issues/729) (transfer to an organization) landed. See [#730](https://github.com/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook/issues/730) for this correction. The sections below are corrected in place rather than struck through, since the underlying decision (adopt merge queue) still stands — only the eligibility assumption was wrong.

## Context

[#673](https://github.com/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook/issues/673) diagnosed a live-lock during concurrent PR throughput (observed in PRs [#661](https://github.com/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook/pull/661) and [#664](https://github.com/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook/pull/664)): `staging.yml`'s `deploy-api`/`deploy-web` jobs share a *global*, not per-PR, concurrency group. GitHub Actions keeps only one pending run per concurrency group, so under sustained multi-PR throughput a newer PR's push silently cancels an older PR's queued deploy. The `staging-integration-tests` job's prerequisite check treats that cancellation as a hard failure of the required `Staging Integration Tests` check. Combined with branch protection's `strict: true` (require branches up to date — see [`branch-protection.md`](../operations/branch-protection.md)), fixing one PR's now-failed check means pushing an update, which re-enters the same contested queue — a live-lock, not just added latency.

### Options considered (from #673)

1. **GitHub merge queue** — serializes required-check re-validation at the front of one queue. ~~Confirmed available: this repo is public, and merge queue's org-only restriction applies to private repos only.~~ **Correction (2026-07-06):** merge queue requires organization ownership regardless of visibility — this repo is owned by a personal account, so it does not currently qualify. See [#729](https://github.com/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook/issues/729).
2. **Make `Staging Integration Tests` non-required**, moving staging validation to post-merge (it already re-runs there via `deploy.yml`'s `smoke-test` job ahead of the manual-approval production gate). Lowest implementation cost, but weakens pre-merge signal.
3. **Per-PR ephemeral staging namespaces** — removes the shared mutex entirely, but multi-week scope (per-PR Cloud Run/k8s namespacing, DB-per-PR or schema-per-PR, cleanup automation) disproportionate to a solo-maintainer repo's throughput problem.
4. **Custom polling-based mutex** (e.g. `softprops/turnstyle`) instead of `concurrency:` — swaps one flakiness class for another (polling/timeout tuning) and does nothing for the branch-protection "up to date" race, which is the other half of the live-lock.

## Decision

**Adopt GitHub merge queue (option 1).** Staged across two PRs to bound the blast radius of a CI-required-check change:

- **[#694](https://github.com/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook/issues/694)** — additive-only: add `merge_group` triggers to `ci.yml` and `staging.yml`, and make every `github.event.pull_request.*` context reference in both files safe under `merge_group` (concurrency groups, the `build-images` fork-repo guard, image tag resolution and Docker tagging, the `dorny/paths-filter` preflight diff, and skipping the PR-comment-only `report-status` job). Zero behavior change to existing `pull_request`/`push` runs.
- **[#695](https://github.com/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook/issues/695)** — after #694 has run for a while and is confirmed stable: enable "Require merge queue" in live branch protection, set Build Concurrency to 1 (keeps the staging-deploy mutex uncontended even inside the queue, given the one shared staging environment), and live-validate via a real PR through the queue. **Now additionally blocked on [#729](https://github.com/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook/issues/729)** (transfer to an organization) — the "Require merge queue" option is not selectable at all under the current personal-account ownership, independent of #694's soak status.

## Rationale

- **Structural fix, not a workaround.** A merge queue is the architecturally correct tool for "required check + strict up-to-date + high PR throughput" — it eliminates the up-to-date race for *all* required checks, not just staging, and removes the deploy-mutex cancellation cascade at its root (at most one queue entry re-validates at a time, so the mutex becomes uncontended rather than merely tolerated).
- **Preserves pre-merge signal**, unlike option 2 — a broken staging integration still blocks the merge rather than landing transiently on `main`.
- ~~**Confirmed available now** at no cost — this repo's public visibility means no plan upgrade or org migration is needed, unlike a private repo would require.~~ **Correction (2026-07-06):** an org migration *is* required — see [#729](https://github.com/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook/issues/729). Public visibility alone does not grant eligibility; organization ownership does, regardless of visibility.
- **Staging's own deploy-mutex groups (`staging-deploy-mutex-api`/`-web`) intentionally stay global and unchanged** — their purpose (serializing writes to the one shared physical staging environment) is orthogonal to which event triggered the job. The merge queue makes that mutex *uncontended in practice*, not irrelevant in principle.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Both the "up to date" race and the staging-mutex cancellation cascade are eliminated for merge-queue-processed PRs, without weakening the pre-merge staging check.
- The fix generalizes to any future required check, not just `Staging Integration Tests`.

**Negative / accepted:**
- **`prod-plan-pr.yml` is not migrated.** It shares the same fork-guard and concurrency-group shape as `staging.yml` but produces no required check (advisory Terraform-plan comment only). A Terraform-touching PR loses that advisory comment when processed through the queue post-#695 — a UX gap, not a safety gap.
- **Fork-PR + merge-queue interaction is assumed, not exhaustively verified against GitHub's docs.** The `build-images` fork-repo guard is skipped entirely for `merge_group` events, on the assumption that merge-queue entries are always same-repo branches. This repo has no fork-PR contribution pattern in practice, making the assumption low-risk even if it does not hold universally.
- **`merge_group.base_sha`/`.head_sha` field names were not fully doc-confirmed at implementation time** (GitHub's published docs are thin on the exact `merge_group` webhook payload shape beyond `head_sha`/`head_ref` being the documented per-entry identifiers). The two diff-comparison uses (`ci.yml`'s observability-smoke, `staging.yml`'s `preflight` job) degrade to a safe default if the field resolves empty (always run the smoke test; `paths-filter` falls back to diffing against the default branch) — a correctness/efficiency loss, never a silent skip. The image-tag use in `staging.yml`'s "Resolve image tag" step instead fails fast with an explicit `::error::` if the field resolves empty, rather than risk producing a malformed Docker tag two steps downstream. #695's live validation is the actual confirmation (now gated on #729 — see Amendment above).
- A regular (non-queued) PR-preview push and a merge-queue entry can still contend for the same global deploy-mutex group — pre-existing behavior, not introduced or worsened by this change.
- **Merge queue eligibility requires organization ownership** ([#729](https://github.com/merickvaughn/lifting-logbook/issues/729)) — ~~this repo is currently owned by a personal user account and does not qualify until transferred.~~ **Resolved 2026-07-22:** the repo now belongs to the `merickvaughn` organization and qualifies; the queue is enabled. #694's `merge_group` wiring, written before the transfer, needed no change to become active.

## Escalation trigger

Revisit if:
- This repo begins accepting fork-PR contributions — the `build-images` merge_group fork-guard carve-out needs re-verification against GitHub's actual fork+merge-queue support at that time.
- #695's live validation shows `merge_group.base_sha`/`.head_sha` do not resolve as expected — fix promptly; blast radius is bounded to reduced efficiency (always-rebuild / always-run-smoke-test), not a broken required check, per the safe-fallback design above.
- ~~#729 stalls or the org transfer is declined — reopen the options-considered analysis (option 2, non-required check, becomes the likely fallback) rather than leaving #673/#695 open indefinitely.~~ **No longer applicable (2026-07-22):** the transfer completed and the queue is live. If the queue itself proves unworkable in practice, option 2 (demote `Staging Integration Tests` to non-required) remains the documented fallback.
