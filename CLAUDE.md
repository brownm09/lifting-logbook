# Claude Code — Lifting Logbook

This file is read automatically by Claude Code at the start of every session.
It replaces the need to paste platform constraints or workflow conventions into your opening brief.
Include in your opening brief only: the issue you are working on, current branch state, and any carry-over context this file cannot know.

---

## Platform & Environment

- **OS:** Windows 11, Git Bash terminal
- **Node:** 20.11.1 (managed by nvm for Windows; `.nvmrc` is set — run `nvm use $(cat .nvmrc)` at session start if not already active).
  - **Node 24 caveat (Windows only):** `npm install` on Windows + Node 24 occasionally extracts dependency tarballs incompletely. Observed symptoms:
    - Missing directories: `node_modules/iconv-lite/lib/`
    - Truncated `.d.ts` files: `node_modules/light-my-request/types/index.d.ts` cut mid-type
    - Malformed native binaries: `node_modules/@turbo/windows-64/bin/turbo.exe` failing with `EFTYPE`

    Downstream failures: `nest build` CJS resolution errors (`iconv-lite/lib/streams`, `minimatch/dist/commonjs/index.js`), `TS1110 Type expected` from `light-my-request`, or `spawnSync ... EFTYPE` from turbo. Fix: `rm -rf node_modules/<package> && npm install <package> --no-save` to re-extract a single package, or `rm -rf node_modules && npm ci` for a full reset. CI runs Node 20 and is unaffected. Original investigation: [#373](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/373).
  - **Node 24 Jest worker OOM (Windows only):** Several `packages/core` CSV-fixture-heavy suites exhaust per-worker heap when run in parallel on Node 24. Codified workaround: `jest.config.base.js` applies `workerIdleMemoryLimit: '512MB'` + `maxWorkers: '50%'` when `process.platform === 'win32'`. Linux Node 20 CI is unaffected by both the failure and the setting. Investigation: [#419](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/419).
  - **Windows full-suite parallel-load flakes (local only):** Under a full `npm test` (`turbo run test` runs several jest processes concurrently), Windows oversubscribes the CPU and produces isolation-only flakes — the api `*.db.e2e.spec.ts` `beforeAll` hooks (DB connect + seed + Nest bootstrap) trip Jest's 5s default hook timeout, and a slow web suite occasionally reports `1 failed`. Codified workaround: the two `apps/api/src/**/*.db.e2e.spec.ts` suites pass an explicit 30s `beforeAll` timeout (`DB_E2E_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS`; apps/api's jest config is standalone and does not extend the win32-capped base), and `jest.config.base.js` adds `testTimeout: 15000` on win32 for the base-extending workspaces (web/core/types/api-client). Linux CI keeps the 5s default. Investigation: [#567](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/567).
- **Package manager:** npm (workspaces)
- **`jq` is NOT available.** Use `node -e` with a temp file in the working directory for JSON parsing:
  ```bash
  TMPFILE="tmp_$$.json"
  some-command --format json > "$TMPFILE"
  node -e "
    const d = JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('$TMPFILE','utf8'));
    console.log('VAR=' + d.field);
  "
  rm -f "$TMPFILE"
  ```
- **Never use `/tmp/`** for temp files — Node.js on Windows cannot resolve Git Bash Unix paths. Write temp files to the working directory instead.
- **`gh` CLI** is available and authenticated. The `project` scope must be added separately when needed: `gh auth refresh -s project`.
- **Prefer Git Bash** over PowerShell for scripting — PowerShell handles arrays and arithmetic differently and has caused failures in this environment.

### Tooling constraints

- **Turborepo 2.x requires a `packageManager` field in the root `package.json`.** Without it, `turbo run *` fails with `Could not resolve workspaces. Missing packageManager field in package.json`. Always ensure `packageManager` is set when scaffolding a new monorepo root or upgrading Turborepo.
- **ESLint 9 uses flat config (`eslint.config.js`), not `.eslintrc.js`.** ESLint 9 dropped `.eslintrc*` support by default, so creating an `.eslintrc.js` silently does nothing. When an issue or acceptance criterion references `.eslintrc.js`, create `eslint.config.js` instead and note the translation in the PR description. Use `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`'s `flat/recommended` config — it is an array of three objects (entry 0 registers the plugin and sets the parser via `languageOptions`), so spread the whole array rather than configuring the parser separately. To fall back to the legacy config format, set `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=false`. Validated in PR #24.

## Repository Layout

Turborepo monorepo with npm workspaces:

```
packages/core        — pure domain logic (no infrastructure dependencies)
packages/types       — shared TypeScript interfaces and API contracts
packages/api-client  — typed REST client with pluggable auth (shared by web server + browser)
apps/api             — NestJS + Fastify (primary): REST + GraphQL
apps/web             — Next.js App Router frontend
apps/mobile          — React Native (Expo) mobile client
infra/kubernetes/    — GKE Autopilot manifests and Helm charts
infra/cloud-run/     — Cloud Run service YAML
infra/terraform/     — Shared infrastructure: VPC, load balancer, DNS, IAM
docs/adr/            — Architecture Decision Records (ADR-001 through ADR-012)
docs/README.md       — Full architecture narrative and ADR index
scripts/             — Repository automation scripts
```

Architecture follows hexagonal / Ports & Adapters. `packages/core` has zero infrastructure dependencies. See [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) for full context.

## GitHub Project & Epic Assignment

All new issues must be added to the **Lifting Logbook** project and assigned an epic before work begins.

**Important:** All `gh project item-list` queries in this file use `--limit 500` to avoid truncation. The project has 327+ items (default limit is 30). If the project grows beyond 500 items, increase this limit accordingly.

**Project IDs (needed for CLI commands):**
- Project number: `2`, owner: `brownm09`
- Project node ID: `PVT_kwHOAjEKvM4BTuEF`
- Epic field ID: `PVTSSF_lAHOAjEKvM4BTuEFzhA7GEs`

**Epic options:**

| Name | Option ID |
|---|---|
| Monorepo Scaffolding | `9dcd9556` |
| Package & App Scaffolding | `ae06cfdd` |
| Port Interfaces | `cc1ae008` |
| Shared Types | `a6b59698` |
| CI/CD Foundation | `fc0df03b` |
| Architecture & Documentation | `f7202bcd` |
| Observability | `d3c68018` |
| API Implementation | `50a1da76` |
| Client Applications | `31d3931e` |
| Operations | `0c3f26d2` |

> **IDs regenerate on every option mutation.** `updateProjectV2Field` with `singleSelectOptions` is a full replacement — passing the existing options unchanged still produces new IDs and drops every item's prior assignment. Always follow the **Backup-and-restore procedure** below before any mutation, and update this table — **plus the other two ID caches listed in step 3** — immediately after.

**Backup-and-restore procedure (mandatory before adding/removing/renaming any single-select option):**

1. Snapshot current Epic assignments to a git-tracked file:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/backups
   STAMP=$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)
   gh api graphql -f query='
     query { node(id: "PVT_kwHOAjEKvM4BTuEF") { ... on ProjectV2 {
       items(first: 100) { nodes { id content { ... on Issue { number title } }
         fieldValues(first: 20) { nodes { ... on ProjectV2ItemFieldSingleSelectValue {
           name field { ... on ProjectV2SingleSelectField { name } } } } } } } } } }' \
     > .claude/backups/project-epic-snapshot-$STAMP.json
   git add .claude/backups/project-epic-snapshot-$STAMP.json
   git commit -m "[chore] Snapshot project Epic assignments before option mutation"
   ```
2. Run the `updateProjectV2Field` mutation with the full desired option list (existing names + new/changed).
3. Capture the new option IDs from the mutation response and update **all three places these IDs are cached**, in the same PR as the snapshot — all must match the live API:
   - the **Epic options** table above;
   - [`.claude/propose.json`](.claude/propose.json) — the `epics` array (consumed by `/propose`);
   - [`.claude/hook-config.json`](.claude/hook-config.json) — the `epic_options` map (consumed by the `post-tool-use.py` project-board hook, which prints them verbatim with no live fetch).

   > `hook-config.json` was the cache omitted in the 2026-05-10 mutation, which left the issue/PR hook suggesting dead Epic option IDs until [#627](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/627). Do not skip it.
4. Restore assignments by reading the snapshot and re-issuing `gh project item-edit` for each item, mapping the snapshot's epic name → new option ID.

If a mutation runs without a prior snapshot commit, stop and recover from the latest snapshot in `.claude/backups/` before continuing any other work.

> **Milestones drift the same way, via a different trigger.** Milestones aren't a ProjectV2 single-select field, so a new milestone isn't created by the `updateProjectV2Field` mutation above — but the table below and the `milestones` arrays in `.claude/hook-config.json` and `.claude/propose.json` are just as easy to leave stale when a new milestone is created via `gh api repos/.../milestones` or the web UI. Update all three in the same PR that adds a milestone.

**Milestones:**

| Title | Number |
|---|---|
| v0.1 — Foundation | `1` |
| v0.2 — Core API | `2` |
| v0.3 — Client Applications | `3` |
| v0.4 — Alpha Release | `4` |

**Workflow — run after `gh issue create`:**

```bash
# Requires project scope — add once if needed: gh auth refresh -s project

# 1. Set milestone (use the milestone title)
gh issue edit <N> --milestone "<milestone-title>"

# 2. Add issue to project, capture item ID
TMPFILE="tmp_$$.json"
gh project item-add 2 --owner brownm09 --url <issue-url> --format json > "$TMPFILE"
ITEM_ID=$(node -e "const d=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('$TMPFILE','utf8')); console.log(d.id);")
rm -f "$TMPFILE"

# 3. Set Epic field
gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwHOAjEKvM4BTuEF --id "$ITEM_ID" \
  --field-id PVTSSF_lAHOAjEKvM4BTuEFzhA7GEs \
  --single-select-option-id <option-id>
```

If `--format json` is not supported by the installed `gh` version, fall back to the GraphQL API via `gh api graphql`.

---

## Standard Issue Workflow

> **Prerequisite:** ensure the issue is already in the Lifting Logbook project with an Epic set (see above).

1. Read the issue body and acceptance criteria: `gh issue view <N>`
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b <type>/issue-<N>-<slug>` (see Branch Naming)
3. Move the issue to **In Progress** on the project board:
   ```bash
   TMPFILE="C:/Users/brown/.claude/scratch/tmp_item_<N>.json"
   gh project item-list 2 --owner brownm09 --limit 500 --format json > "$TMPFILE"
   ITEM_ID=$(node -e "
     const d=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('$TMPFILE','utf8'));
     const item=d.items.find(i=>i.content&&i.content.number===<N>);
     console.log(item.id);
   ")
   rm -f "$TMPFILE"
   gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwHOAjEKvM4BTuEF --id "$ITEM_ID" \
     --field-id PVTSSF_lAHOAjEKvM4BTuEFzhA7F7E \
     --single-select-option-id 47fc9ee4
   ```
4. Implement the changes
5. Commit with `Closes #<N>` in the message (see Commit Format)
6. Push: `git push -u origin <branch>`
7. Open a PR: `gh pr create --title "<prefix> <title>" --body "..."`
8. After PR approval: squash merge using the two-step pattern documented in the global
   [`CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/brownm09/dev-env/blob/main/claude/CLAUDE.md) under
   "Worktree holding the base branch blocks `gh pr merge --delete-branch`'s local step" —
   rather than a single `gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch`. This repo hits the squat
   variant of that failure often: 60+ concurrent worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/` make it
   common for some worktree to be holding `main` at merge time (confirmed on
   [PR #664](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/pull/664), 2026-07-03). If a squat is
   actively blocking a merge right now, the on-demand clear procedure is in the
   [dev-env runbook](https://github.com/brownm09/dev-env/blob/main/docs/REFERENCE.md#git-workflow-runbooks).
9. Move the issue to **Done** on the project board:
   ```bash
   TMPFILE="C:/Users/brown/.claude/scratch/tmp_item_<N>.json"
   gh project item-list 2 --owner brownm09 --limit 500 --format json > "$TMPFILE"
   ITEM_ID=$(node -e "
     const d=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('$TMPFILE','utf8'));
     const item=d.items.find(i=>i.content&&i.content.number===<N>);
     console.log(item.id);
   ")
   rm -f "$TMPFILE"
   gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwHOAjEKvM4BTuEF --id "$ITEM_ID" \
     --field-id PVTSSF_lAHOAjEKvM4BTuEFzhA7F7E \
     --single-select-option-id 98236657
   ```
10. Pull main: `git checkout main && git pull`
11. Close the issue if not auto-closed: `gh issue close <N>`
12. Update journals and tracking:
    - **Project journal** (`sessions/lifting-logbook/`): write or update this session's **stub** per the global journal workflow (see [Engineering Journal](#engineering-journal)) — PR merged, decisions made
    - **Meta journal** (`sessions/meta/`): update if `CLAUDE.md` was modified or a new platform constraint was discovered
    - **ROADMAP.md**: if this PR completes a work stream listed in a milestone's Active Work table, move that row to the milestone's Shipped table; if the Active Work table becomes empty, replace it with `| *(all shipped)* | | |`
13. Write the stub's `<!-- next-session-context -->` block and display it as the closing output of the session

### REST-endpoint fallback when the shared GraphQL rate limit is exhausted

The `gh pr *` commands the steps above depend on — `gh pr create` (step 7), `gh pr merge`
(step 8), `gh pr view --json`, `gh pr comment` — are **all GraphQL** calls, and this repo's 60+
concurrent worktrees share **one GitHub API rate-limit bucket per resource class**. GraphQL can
therefore exhaust while the separate **REST (core)** bucket is still healthy. Motivating incident:
[PR #700](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/pull/700)'s session (2026-07-05) — `gh pr
create` died with `GraphQL: API rate limit already exceeded` while REST core showed 4999/5000. The
buckets are independent, so when a `gh pr` command fails that way, don't wait for the reset — fall
back to the REST equivalents. (The global
[`CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/brownm09/dev-env/blob/main/claude/CLAUDE.md) documents the rate-limit
*hazard*; the steps below are the *mitigation*.)

- **Compare both buckets first** — REST usually still has budget:
  ```bash
  gh api rate_limit
  # resources.graphql = gh pr create / merge / view --json / comment
  # resources.core    = the gh api REST calls below
  ```
- **Create a PR** instead of `gh pr create` — write the body to a scratch file first so backticks
  aren't mangled by the shell:
  ```bash
  gh api -X POST repos/brownm09/lifting-logbook/pulls \
    -f title="[docs] ..." -f head="<branch>" -f base=main \
    -F body=@C:/Users/brown/.claude/scratch/pr-body.md
  ```
- **Merge.** `gh pr merge <N> --auto --squash` is a single lightweight GraphQL call that arms GitHub
  to squash-merge once checks pass — prefer it while GraphQL has *any* budget. If GraphQL is fully
  exhausted, merge and delete the branch entirely over REST (the same server-side merge + ref-delete
  as step 8, reached without GraphQL):
  ```bash
  gh api -X PUT repos/brownm09/lifting-logbook/pulls/<N>/merge -f merge_method=squash
  gh api -X DELETE "repos/brownm09/lifting-logbook/git/refs/heads/<branch>"
  ```
- **Inspect PR state** instead of `gh pr view --json`:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/brownm09/lifting-logbook/pulls/<N>
  ```

## Commit Message Format

```
[<type>] <imperative-mood description>

<body — optional, for non-obvious decisions or multi-part changes>

Closes #<N>
```

**Types:** `chore`, `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `infra`, `test`, `refactor`

**Example:**
```
[chore] Initialize Turborepo monorepo with workspace structure

Converts root package.json to private workspaces, adds turbo.json pipeline,
and creates directory skeleton with .gitkeep placeholders.

Closes #1
```

---

## PR Conventions

- **Title format:** `[<type>] <description>` (matching the commit type prefix)
- **Body:** Summary paragraph + Acceptance Criteria checklist (copy from issue) + test instructions
- **Merge strategy:** Squash merge only — keeps `main` history linear
- **Branch cleanup:** Delete the branch after merge — use the two-step pattern in Standard Issue Workflow step 8, not a bare `--delete-branch`, since that flag's local step can fail when a worktree is squatting `main`

---

## Files to Never Read

These files are large and never need to be read directly:

- `package-lock.json` — 8,000+ lines; commit it without reading it
- `node_modules/**` — never relevant
- `.turbo/**` — build cache, never relevant

---

## Worktree Setup

Claude Code creates git worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/` when running tasks in isolation.
A new worktree has its own directory but **does not inherit a working `node_modules`** from the
main repo. Before the first commit in a worktree, always run:

```bash
npm install
```

**Why this is required:**

- The pre-commit hook (`npx turbo run lint`) needs `turbo`, which is a native binary downloaded
  during the `postinstall` script. Without `npm install`, the hook fails with
  `Error: spawnSync ... EUNKNOWN` or `%1 is not a valid Win32 application`.
- On Windows, worktrees under paths containing `.claude` cannot spawn the native `turbo.exe`
  from that path. `.husky/pre-commit` works around this by setting `TURBO_BINARY_PATH` to
  the main repo root's turbo binary — but this only works if `npm install` has been run in the
  worktree first, so that `npx turbo` resolves correctly. See [ADR-022](docs/adr/ADR-022-monorepo-docker-build-strategy.md) for broader context on why the toolchain is sensitive to install state.

**Symptom if skipped:** `Lint failed. Commit aborted.` or a Node.js `EUNKNOWN` crash on the first
`git commit`.

**Recovery after a failed `npm ci` (EUSAGE) + `npm install`:** when a lockfile-drift `npm ci`
fails mid-install and you recover with `npm install`, the worktree-local `node_modules/turbo` can
be left **missing or incomplete** — the test suite may have kept running via the *global* `turbo`,
masking the gap. The next `git commit` then fails the `.husky/pre-commit` lint hook with
`Lint failed. Commit aborted.` **even though `npx turbo run lint` passes standalone** (the hook
requires the worktree-local `turbo` via `TURBO_BINARY_PATH`, not the global one). The fix is a
clean **`npm ci`** once the lockfile is back in sync — *not* another `npm install`, which can
leave the same partial-extract state. Motivating incident: the #570/#571 session (Windows, Node 20).

---

## CLI Scripting Checklist

Before writing a `gh` or other CLI automation script:

1. Run `<command> --help` first to confirm flag names and syntax
2. Confirm which JSON tools are available (`jq` is NOT available — use `node -e`)
3. Confirm temp file location (`C:/Users/brown/.claude/scratch/`, not `/tmp/` or a project repo directory)
4. Check whether any additional `gh` auth scopes are needed

---

## Proposals and Roadmap

### /propose workflow

Run `/propose <one-line idea>` from the repo root to introduce a new feature or change.
The skill handles the full flow: clarifying questions → proposal doc → GitHub issue → ROADMAP entry → PR.

Do not create `docs/proposals/` files or ROADMAP entries manually unless `/propose` is
unavailable. The skill ensures the issue, epic, and milestone are assigned consistently.

### docs/proposals/ convention

- Files live at `docs/proposals/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
- The master template is at `dev-env/claude/templates/proposal.md` — do not duplicate it here
- Statuses: `draft` → `accepted` → `shipped` | `declined`
- Update the `**Status:**` field in the proposal file when status changes
- Update the linked issue's milestone or labels to match if scope changes

### ROADMAP.md maintenance

- `ROADMAP.md` at the repo root is the editorial view; it is **not** a GitHub mirror
- `/propose` appends rows to the correct milestone's **Proposals** table automatically
- Update the **Active Work** tables manually when: an item starts, completes, or moves milestones
- Material milestone-scope changes (dropping or moving items) require a PR with an explicit
  explanation — same bar as material changes to `docs/PRD.md`

---

## Coding Standards

App-level coding standards are in `docs/standards/`. Each file is a self-contained rule with
rationale, examples, and enforcement notes. Existing standards:

| File | Applies to | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| [`docs/standards/fetch-cache-semantics.md`](docs/standards/fetch-cache-semantics.md) | `apps/web` Server Components | All `fetch()` calls must specify `{ cache: 'no-store' }` or `{ next: { revalidate: N } }` explicitly |
| [`docs/standards/error-fallback-test-coverage.md`](docs/standards/error-fallback-test-coverage.md) | all packages and apps | Error-swallowing fallbacks (`.catch(() => default)`, `?? default`, try/catch returning neutral) require a data-level assertion, a paired success-path test, or a documented structure-only comment |
| [`docs/standards/training-max-precision.md`](docs/standards/training-max-precision.md) | all packages and apps | Directly-known training-max weights are never rounded; formula-derived estimates floor to the nearest plate increment; computed per-workout weights round to the nearest *loadable* plate combination |

When implementing `apps/web`, read the relevant standards before writing any `fetch()` calls.

---

## Testing

Run `npm test` from the repo root to execute the full test suite across all workspaces.

```bash
npm test
```

Type-checking runs as a separate Turbo task. ts-jest runs **transpile-only** for speed (see
[#651](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/651)), so a dedicated `tsc --noEmit` gate
owns type-checking for `core` and `web`. It is a **blocking CI gate** (CI runs
`turbo run lint typecheck test`) — run it before opening a PR:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Run `npm run build` first if you have touched compiled output (e.g., API controllers, shared types in `packages/types`).
- The API DB E2E suite (`apps/api/src/programs/programs.db.e2e.spec.ts`) auto-provisions Postgres via Testcontainers in `apps/api/jest.global-setup.js`. Docker Desktop must be running; no `DATABASE_URL` configuration is required locally. In CI, the existing service container provides `DATABASE_URL` and globalSetup uses it directly.
- **When Docker is down:** globalSetup hard-fails with a multi-line actionable message naming three recovery options (fix Docker, use `docker-compose.test.yml`, or set `LIFTING_SKIP_DB_E2E=1`). The escape hatch is only valid when the diff under test touches no DB code (no changes under `apps/api/prisma/`, no repository changes); cite [issue #394](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/394) in the PR body when it is used. See [`docs/testing/e2e-coverage.md`](docs/testing/e2e-coverage.md) for the full recovery procedure.

Individual workspaces can be verified independently:

```bash
npm test -w @lifting-logbook/core
npm test -w @lifting-logbook/api
npm test -w @lifting-logbook/web
```

### apps/web Playwright E2E (local)

`apps/web` has two test layers. `npm test -w @lifting-logbook/web` runs Jest unit/component tests only. A separate Playwright suite lives in `apps/web/e2e/` and runs in CI's "Playwright E2E" job — it does **not** run as part of `npm test`.

**Run it locally before pushing whenever a change touches `apps/web` and any of the following:**

- UI display strings (headings, button labels, link text)
- `aria-label` values on inputs or regions
- Role names, tab labels, dialog titles
- Any string a Playwright `getByLabel` / `getByRole` / `locator('text=...')` call might match

```bash
# From the repo root — playwright.config.ts auto-starts mock-api + next dev on per-run dynamic ports (#746)
npm run test:e2e -w @lifting-logbook/web
```

Playwright browsers must be installed once (`npx playwright install chromium`; CI uses the `--with-deps` form for its Linux runner — that flag is a no-op on Windows). The config handles all env vars (dummy Clerk keys, `DEV_AUTH_TOKEN`, `API_URL`) so no manual setup is needed. The motivating incident is [#444](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/444) / PR #438, where an aria-label rename (`Back Squat` → `Squat`) passed Jest but broke the smoke spec and was only caught by CI.

**Heavy on-demand-compiled routes need a `beforeAll` warmup.** When a Playwright e2e spec targets a heavy App Router route that Next dev compiles on-demand (e.g. `/import`), the first cold compile on Windows local dev can exceed Playwright's default `expect` (5s) *and* per-test (30s) timeouts — the first `page.goto` dies before any assertion runs. Warm the route once in a `test.beforeAll` that navigates a throwaway page to it with generous headroom (`test.setTimeout(120_000)` plus a ~90s `goto`/`expect` timeout), so every test then runs against an already-compiled route; CI (Linux) compiles fast enough that the warmup is a no-op there. Reference implementation: [`apps/web/e2e/import.spec.ts`](apps/web/e2e/import.spec.ts); motivating incident [#698](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/698) / [PR #715](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/pull/715).

**Troubleshooting — `ECONNREFUSED` on Windows (all e2e tests fail at once).** If every test fails with `apiRequestContext.get: connect ECONNREFUSED` (on `::1:3004` *or* `127.0.0.1:3004`) and `page.goto` hangs until it times out, the cause is an IPv4/IPv6 loopback mismatch, not a UI-string regression. On Windows the `webServer` processes (`node e2e/mock-api.mjs` on :3004, `next dev` on :3000) bind loopback **non-deterministically** — the default `server.listen(port)` / `next dev` host can come up IPv4-only *or* `::1`-only across runs — while Node 18+'s `verbatim` DNS resolves `localhost` to `::1` first. So a client dialing one family can reach a server listening on the other and get refused. The harness pins **everything** to `127.0.0.1` (unambiguous IPv4 loopback on every platform) so client, server bind, and readiness probe always agree: Playwright `use.baseURL`, the webServer `API_URL` / `PUBLIC_API_URL` env, `next dev --hostname 127.0.0.1`, the `url:` readiness probes (not bare `port:`) — all in [`apps/web/playwright.config.ts`](apps/web/playwright.config.ts) — plus the mock's `server.listen(PORT, '127.0.0.1')` bind in [`apps/web/e2e/mock-api.mjs`](apps/web/e2e/mock-api.mjs) and the `MOCK_API` constant in each spec. Linux CI is unaffected (`localhost` and `127.0.0.1` both resolve to IPv4 loopback there), so **keep these on `127.0.0.1`, never `localhost`** — reverting any one of them reintroduces the Windows failure. Because `reuseExistingServer` is on locally, a leftover/zombie server from a prior run could once be silently reused across worktrees; [#746](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/746) fixed that structurally — `playwright.config.ts` now allocates a **free port per run** (`allocatePorts()`) for both the mock and `next dev`, threading it through `MOCK_API_PORT` / `PLAYWRIGHT_MOCK_API_URL` and `use.baseURL`, so concurrent worktrees each start their own servers and never share. A stale server squatting this run's freshly-allocated port is astronomically unlikely and would surface as a startup `EADDRINUSE`, not a silent wrong-build reuse. Motivating incidents: [#741](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/741) (127.0.0.1 host pinning), [#746](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/746) (per-worktree dynamic ports).

### Turbo version pin sync (Dockerfile ↔ package.json)

`apps/web/Dockerfile`'s installer stage pins `npx turbo@<version> prune` to an exact version — `node_modules` is dockerignored ahead of that step, so a bare `npx turbo` has no local install to prefer and would fetch whatever the registry currently tags `latest`. That pin must match the root `package.json`'s `devDependencies.turbo` exactly, or the prune step and the later `npm ci`/build step in the same image run under two different turbo versions with nothing to catch the drift until an uncached Docker build. See [#674](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/674) / [#692](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/692).

**Run before pushing whenever `apps/web/Dockerfile` or the root `package.json`'s `turbo` devDependency changes:**

```bash
node scripts/check-turbo-version-sync.mjs
```

This also runs as a CI step (`ci.yml` → `lint-and-test` → "Verify turbo version pin sync"), so a drifting PR fails either way — running it locally just catches the mismatch before waiting on CI.

### Coverage Requirements

<!-- When #259 ships: remove the "until then" clause from the frontend row below. Tracked as a checklist item on issue #259. -->

| Change type | Required coverage |
|---|---|
| New API endpoint | In-memory E2E test in the same PR |
| New frontend page or interactive feature | Playwright test once #259 is implemented; until then, a written test plan in the PR body |
| `apps/web` UI string / aria-label / role-name change | Run `npm run test:e2e -w @lifting-logbook/web` locally before pushing (see above) |
| Bug fix | Regression test that fails before the fix and passes after |
| Refactor / docs only | None required — existing tests must pass |

**Blocking rule:** A PR that adds an API endpoint or frontend feature without satisfying the above is not mergeable.

### Failure-tracking rule

Every test failure reported in a pre-PR run must be resolved in one of two ways before `gh pr create`:

1. **Fixed in this PR** (default).
2. **Tracked by an open GitHub issue cited in the PR body** by number — prose explanation alone is not sufficient. If the failure does not yet have an issue, file one before opening the PR.

A label of "pre-existing" without an open-issue link is not acceptable. The motivating incident is [#349 / PR #355](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/pull/355), where four API suite-load failures were carried as "pre-existing" until a one-line `postinstall` hook fixed the entire class — the rule should have forced the investigation up front. The global equivalent of this rule is tracked in [dev-env#281](https://github.com/brownm09/dev-env/issues/281).

### Skewed-test rule

When a PR adds or modifies a `.catch(() => default)`, `?? default`, or `try { … } catch { return neutral }` in a server component or API boundary, the test coverage for that code path must satisfy one of: (a) a data-level assertion the fallback would not produce, (b) a separate test that fails specifically when the upstream fails, or (c) an inline comment that names the swallowed-fallback source line and explains why structure-only is intentional. See [`docs/standards/error-fallback-test-coverage.md`](docs/standards/error-fallback-test-coverage.md) for the full rule and examples.

### Typecheck TS7016 on `react-dom/server` — incomplete install, not a code defect

**Pattern:** `npm run typecheck` fails on `apps/web` with:

```
error TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'react-dom/server'.
'.../apps/web/node_modules/react-dom/server.node.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
```

on the five `page.test.tsx` files that `import { renderToStaticMarkup } from 'react-dom/server'`.

**Root cause:** `react-dom@19`'s `package.json` `exports["./server"]` ships only runtime conditions (`node → server.node.js`, `browser`, `default`, …) and **no `types` condition**, so TypeScript cannot source the `react-dom/server` declaration from `react-dom` itself — it resolves the declaration solely from the **`@types/react-dom` devDependency** (whose `exports["./server"].types → server.d.ts`). `react-dom` is a runtime `dependency` while `@types/react-dom` is a `devDependency`, so any install that has deps but not devDeps — `npm install --omit=dev`, a partial/interrupted extract, or a worktree whose `npm install` never completed — leaves `react-dom` present but `@types/react-dom` absent → TS7016 on every `react-dom/server` import. It is **not** a version or `tsconfig` bug: a clean install (`npm ci` in CI, a fresh worktree `npm install`) always resolves it, and `@types/react-dom` resolves whether it sits in `apps/web/node_modules` or is hoisted to the repo-root `node_modules`.

**Symptom that confirms it:** the error names a `server.node.js` runtime file (so `react-dom` IS installed) rather than "Cannot find module" (which would mean `react-dom` itself is missing); the same five files pass under `npm ci` or a completed `npm install`.

**Fix:** run a full install in the worktree — `npm install`, or `rm -rf node_modules && npm ci` — then re-run `npm run typecheck`. (Root-hoisting `@types/react` + `@types/react-dom` into the **root** `package.json` so they always resolve from `apps/web` even when the workspace-local copy is missing would harden this further, but currently `ERESOLVE`s against `apps/mobile`'s Expo 54 / RN 0.81 `@types/react@19.1.x` pin vs. `@types/react-dom@19.2.3`'s `@types/react@^19.2.0` peer requirement — tracked in [#777](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/777).) Motivating incident: [#769](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/769).

### CI not firing — merge conflict silences GitHub Actions

**Pattern:** A PR in `CONFLICTING` (merge conflict) state causes GitHub Actions `pull_request` events to never fire. GitHub cannot create the virtual merge commit at `refs/pull/N/merge`, so the event is silently dropped — no checks are queued, no runs appear.

**Symptom:** `gh pr checks` returns "no checks reported" and `gh run list --branch <branch-name>` shows only stale runs from before the conflict.

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
gh pr view <N> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus
# mergeable: "CONFLICTING" — direct conflict indicator; mergeStateStatus will also be "DIRTY"
```

**Fix:** `git fetch origin` first (the rebase target is only as current as this repo's local `origin/main` tracking ref — a stale ref means the rebase resolves against outdated content and doesn't actually clear the conflict against the real current `main`). Then rebase (or squash-rebase) the branch onto `origin/main` and force-push. Once the conflict is resolved, GitHub recreates the merge ref and CI fires normally on the next push.

Motivating incident: [PR #604](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/pull/604).

### Stale-branch squash-merge rejection — update-branch API silently uses a stale main

**Pattern:** lifting-logbook has `allow_update_branch: false` in its repo settings (confirmed via `gh api repos/brownm09/lifting-logbook --jq .allow_update_branch`). When a PR's branch falls behind `main` and `gh pr merge --squash` is rejected with "the head branch is not up to date with the base branch", calling `gh api -X PUT repos/brownm09/lifting-logbook/pulls/<N>/update-branch` returns an apparent-success message (`{"message":"Updating pull request branch."}`) but the update can silently apply against a **stale snapshot** of `main` — not the current tip — with no error surfaced. In one observed case, the resulting merge commit's merged-in `main` SHA matched the PR's *original* base ref from when it was first opened, not `main`'s actual current HEAD, even though `main` had moved significantly since. `mergeStateStatus` stayed `BEHIND` for 9+ minutes with no indication anything was wrong.

**Symptom:** `mergeStateStatus` remains `BEHIND` well after `update-branch` reports success, and the eventual merge commit's second parent is not `main`'s actual current tip.

**Diagnosis:** After calling `update-branch`, check the resulting merge commit's second parent directly against `main`'s real tip:
```bash
gh pr view <N> --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid   # PR branch tip after update-branch
git log -1 --format="%P" <merge-commit-sha>          # second hash is the merged-in main SHA
git rev-parse origin/main
```
If they don't match, the API used a stale snapshot.

**Fix:** Don't rely on the `update-branch` API for this repo. Instead, manually merge: create a worktree for the PR's branch, `git fetch origin` (the merge is only as current as this repo's local `origin/main` tracking ref), `git merge origin/main`, resolve any conflicts, `git push`. This is deterministic and uses the actual current `main` tip.

Motivating incident: [PR #722](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/pull/722) merge session, 2026-07-08.

### Staging-deploy queue starvation — cross-PR mutex preemption

**Pattern:** `.github/workflows/staging.yml`'s `deploy-api`/`deploy-web` jobs serialize writes to the one shared staging Cloud Run service / Helm release via job-level concurrency groups (`staging-deploy-mutex-api`, `staging-deploy-mutex-web`, both `cancel-in-progress: false`). These groups are global, not per-PR. GitHub Actions keeps only the most-recently-queued run per concurrency group — when a third PR pushes while a second PR's deploy is already queued behind a first PR's running deploy, the second PR's queued run is silently cancelled and the third takes its place. Under sustained multi-PR throughput this can repeat for an unlucky PR across many cycles.

**Symptom:** The required `Staging Integration Tests` check fails with "Staging did not become ready in time" or an empty `WEB_URL`, even on a PR whose diff cannot plausibly affect staging (e.g. docs-only). The `deploy-api` or `deploy-web` job's own result shows `cancelled` rather than `failure`.

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
gh run list --workflow=staging.yml -R brownm09/lifting-logbook --limit 20
```
Open the cancelled run's job log — GitHub Actions annotates the cancellation directly: `Canceling since a higher priority waiting request for staging-deploy-mutex-web exists`.

**Fix:** Re-run once the queue has a lull:
```bash
gh run rerun <run-id> --failed
```
This is a known, already-diagnosed CI mechanic, not a new bug — see [#673](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/673) for the full root-cause analysis and [ADR-030](docs/adr/ADR-030-github-merge-queue-adoption.md) for the accepted structural fix (GitHub merge queue). Activation is tracked in [#695](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/695); until it lands, re-running after the queue clears is the only workaround.

## Observability

This repo runs a full OpenTelemetry + Grafana Cloud stack. The Plan-then-optimize → Pass 3
**Observability** dimension defers to this section (per dev-env [ADR-042](https://github.com/brownm09/dev-env/blob/main/docs/adr/042-plan-risk-dimension-audit-and-observability-section.md)).

### Convention

- **Logging** — `nestjs-pino` (Pino), **structured JSON**, standard Pino levels (runtime-configurable). Configured in [`apps/api/src/app.module.ts`](apps/api/src/app.module.ts). Auth-bearing headers are redacted with `remove: true` (`req.headers.authorization`, `req.headers.cookie`, `req/res set-cookie`); `/health` is excluded from auto-logging to control Grafana Cloud log spend.
- **Tracing & metrics** — OpenTelemetry NodeSDK in [`apps/api/src/otel.ts`](apps/api/src/otel.ts): `OTLPTraceExporter` + `OTLPMetricExporter` (OTLP/HTTP) with `getNodeAutoInstrumentations()` (HTTP/Fastify, `pg`, Node built-ins). Service name defaults to `lifting-logbook-api`. The web app instruments via `@vercel/otel` ([`apps/web/instrumentation.ts`](apps/web/instrumentation.ts)).
- **Backends** — Grafana Cloud via the OTel Collector: traces → **Tempo**, logs → **Loki**, metrics → **Mimir** (see [ADR-018](docs/adr/ADR-018-observability-stack.md)).
- **Log↔trace correlation** — a Pino `mixin()` injects `trace_id` / `span_id` from the active span into every log line, enabling bidirectional Loki↔Tempo navigation in Grafana.
- **Errors** — domain exceptions are mapped to HTTP responses by per-feature exception filters (e.g. `apps/api/src/programs/conflict.filter.ts`, `not-found.filter.ts`); request/response logging — including error responses, carrying `trace_id`/`span_id` via the `mixin` — is emitted by `nestjs-pino`/`pino-http` auto-logging. Error spans on the failing request are retained by the tail-based sampling policy ([ADR-020](docs/adr/ADR-020-tail-based-sampling-policy.md)).
- **Client-side write errors** — every `apps/web` mutation invoked from a Client Component (the writes re-exported by `apps/web/lib/client-api.ts`) reports its caught error through [`apps/web/lib/log-client-error.ts`](apps/web/lib/log-client-error.ts) (`logClientError('<op>', err, ctx?)`), which emits a consistent, greppable `[client-mutation] <op> failed` line to the browser console — never a bare `console.error` or an empty `catch {}`. `apps/web` instruments only the server runtime today (`@vercel/otel`, [`apps/web/instrumentation.ts`](apps/web/instrumentation.ts)); `logClientError` is the single seam where a browser→Grafana export attaches (tracked in [#798](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/798)). Origin: [#783](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/783).

### What the Observability audit dimension must verify for this repo

1. **Raw SQL is NOT auto-traced.** `@prisma/instrumentation` is excluded from the OTel SDK due to an SDK v1/v2 incompatibility ([ADR-024](docs/adr/ADR-024-prisma-otel-sdk-override.md)). Prisma Client ORM calls and any `$queryRaw` / `$executeRaw` emit **no spans**. Any new raw-SQL call site must be wrapped in a **manual span** to remain observable. (There are currently zero raw-SQL usages — this is a forward-looking gate.)
2. **LLM adapters apply NO PII scrubbing to prompts.** The cycle-planning adapters (`apps/api/src/adapters/llm/anthropic-cycle-planning.adapter.ts`, `openai-compatible-cycle-planning.adapter.ts`) send user context to the provider unscrubbed. New LLM call sites must consider prompt-content exposure before sending or logging.
3. **Redaction covers headers, not arbitrary payloads.** The Pino `redact` config strips auth headers/cookies only. New API boundaries must log at appropriate levels and must never log secrets, tokens, or sensitive request/response bodies.
4. **Client-side mutations must not swallow errors.** Every write invoked from a Client Component must route its caught error through [`apps/web/lib/log-client-error.ts`](apps/web/lib/log-client-error.ts) (`logClientError`) — never an empty `catch {}`, a bare `console.error`, or an uncaught rejection. Context passed to the helper carries ids/actions only, never secrets, tokens, or request bodies (the api-client throws only `Error(message)`/`ApiClientError`, so the caught error itself is safe to log). See [#783](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/783).

## Documentation and Citations

When writing or updating any architectural documentation (ADRs, design docs, READMEs):

- **Every ADR must have a `## References` section.** New ADRs get one on creation. Existing ADRs get one when they receive substantive edits. See `docs/adr-references.md` for the established pattern.
- **Update `docs/adr-references.md`** whenever an ADR's references change — it is the consolidated index.
- **Cite primary sources, not summaries.** Three categories:
  - *Official documentation* — for technology and framework choices (NestJS, Next.js, Prisma, etc.)
  - *Specifications* — for protocol and standard choices (IETF RFCs, OASIS specs, GraphQL spec, OpenID Connect)
  - *Foundational writings* — for architectural patterns (Cockburn's Hexagonal Architecture, Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture, Fowler articles)
- **Regulatory references** (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2) must link to the primary regulatory source, not a summary or blog post.
- **When recommending a technology in any response**, include a link to its official documentation in that same response — not just the name.

## Engineering Journal

The engineering-journal workflow — per-session **stub** files, the sharded per-session **manifest**
and per-PR **open-PR** companion files, the project *and* meta journal update triggers, and the
end-of-day `/journal-compose` step — is owned in full by the global
[`CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/brownm09/dev-env/blob/main/claude/CLAUDE.md) **→ Engineering
Journal** section. File formats (the stub template, the manifest / open-PR shard schemas) and the
canonical 11-section compose structure live in that repo's
[`docs/REFERENCE.md` → Engineering Journal Internals](https://github.com/brownm09/dev-env/blob/main/docs/REFERENCE.md#engineering-journal-internals).

**Follow the global workflow as written — do not duplicate or re-derive it here.** This repo's
session hooks already emit the sharded stub / `open-prs/<N>.json` reminders directly after a PR is
opened or merged.

The only lifting-logbook-specific parameter is the **project journal path:**
`sessions/lifting-logbook/` — substitute it wherever the global workflow says `sessions/<project>/`
(the `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.stub.md` files, the `*.manifest.jsonl` shards, the `open-prs/<N>.json`
shards, and `reports/`).

> Historical note: this section previously documented a single-draft-file-per-day workflow
> (`YYYY-MM-DD_draft.md` hand-edited across sessions, composed at day end). That workflow was
> retired when the global config moved to the sharded stub/manifest system; see
> [#772](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/772).
