    // action persists the value verbatim and does no further adjustment. Runs after
    // switchProgram so it overrides any maxes the cycle seeded. The PATCH endpoint
    // merges and appends unknown lifts, so any catalog or custom lift name is accepted.

    // Best-effort by design: switchProgram has already created (or found) the cycle, so a
    // max-persistence failure must not strand the user on the program-selection
    // step with a cycle that exists but is unreachable from this flow. Training
    // maxes are editable later in settings, so we log and proceed to the cycle
    // rather than failing the whole flow.

    // Error-fallback coverage (docs/standards/error-fallback-test-coverage.md,
    // option c): the catch below intentionally swallows the PATCH error after
    // logging it server-side; the success path (maxes reach updateTrainingMaxes)
    // is asserted in OnboardingFlow.test.tsx, and the swallow only changes
    // post-cycle-creation behavior, which has no client-visible data to assert.
