// requesting user's current cycle (and its dependent rows) so the onboarding write-
// path test can run repeatedly against the same account without hitting the
// "cycle already exists" short-circuit in switchProgram
// (apps/api/src/programs/switch-program.controller.ts).
//
// Uses the SAME auth mechanism as the real "Start My Program" flow (lib/api.ts's
// X-Clerk-Authorization strategy) rather than a special-cased path — see
// docs/adr/ADR-023-staging-integration-test-design.md's "Alternatives Considered"
// for why the two more "obvious" shortcuts (server getToken()+forward, client
// getToken()+direct-fetch) are both already known to be flaky against this
// specific staging Clerk instance; this route intentionally does not reinvent
// either.
//
// Not linked from any UI; not documented as a public API. It is still a real,
// destructive, auth-gated-but-not-environment-gated endpoint, so it is
// deliberately inert wherever CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY is a live (pk_live_) key —
// per docs/deploy.md, staging uses pk_test_ and production uses pk_live_, and
// apps/web is built once and promoted to both (ADR-028), so this runtime check
// is the only way to keep the route staging-only without a new deploy-time env
// var. "Not linked from any UI" alone is not a control; this is.
