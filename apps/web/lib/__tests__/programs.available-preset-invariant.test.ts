/**
 * Forward-looking guard for the issue #739 class of bug. Every program the
 * onboarding catalog marks `available: true` must resolve to a non-empty
 * built-in spec (`PRESET_BASE_SPECS[id]`), otherwise an onboarded user of that
 * program gets an empty cycle view. This catches the *other* way this gap can
 * open: flipping a catalog program to `available: true` without adding its
 * preset (the seeding side is guarded by the API repository tests).
 *
 * Catalog programs left `available: false` are intentional future work and are
 * deliberately not asserted here.
