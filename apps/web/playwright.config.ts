// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Per-worktree dynamic ports (#746)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This repo routinely runs many concurrent git worktrees under .claude/worktrees/, which
// historically all shared the fixed ports :3004 (mock API) and :3000 (next dev). With
// `reuseExistingServer` true locally, two overlapping `npm run test:e2e` runs from different
// worktrees would silently attach to whichever mock/next server was already listening — so a
// run could pass or fail against another worktree's build. Allocating a free port per run and
// threading it through the webServers, `use.baseURL`, and the specs' MOCK_API base makes
// overlapping local runs independent. #741/#744 pinned the loopback HOST to 127.0.0.1 (the
// Windows IPv4/IPv6 fix) — that is preserved below; only the PORT is dynamic, never the host.
//
// `reuseExistingServer` is off everywhere (was `!process.env.CI` = false in CI, true locally):
// with a fresh port per run there is never a matching pre-existing server to reuse, and forcing
// the rare free-port race to fail as a loud EADDRINUSE — rather than silently attach to another
// worktree's server — is exactly the guarantee #746 wants. CI stays false, so CI is unchanged.

// Grab `count` free 127.0.0.1 ports for this run. Runs in a short-lived child `node` process
// because Playwright loads this config as CommonJS — the top-level `await` a JS free-port probe
// needs is a SyntaxError here — and holds every listener open simultaneously so the OS returns
// distinct ports before releasing them for the real servers to claim. The usual free-port TOCTOU
// window applies; a lost race surfaces as a startup EADDRINUSE (loud) rather than a silent
// wrong-server reuse.
