/**
 * Establishes the per-request Postgres Row-Level Security context (issue #511).
 *
 * For every authenticated HTTP request that reaches the Prisma-backed factory, it opens one
 * interactive transaction, sets the `app.current_user_id` GUC (a SET LOCAL, via `set_config`) so
 * RLS policies resolve to the caller, and stores the transaction client in CLS so
 * PrismaRepositoryFactory routes every repository query through it. The GUC is transaction-local,
 * which is why all of a request's DB work shares a single transaction.
 *
 * No-ops when there is no Prisma client AND no DATABASE_URL configured (in-memory / SystemDb
 * factories), or when there is no authenticated user (public routes such as /health and /readyz).
 * Those run on the base client with no GUC — which is fail-closed for any userId-scoped table
 * (zero rows) and harmless for the table-less probes.
 *
 * If DATABASE_URL IS configured but the Prisma client still can't be resolved, that's broken DI
 * plumbing (issue #644), not a legitimate no-DB environment — silently falling through here
 * produces "empty reads / rejected writes" symptoms indistinguishable from "this user has no data
 * yet," which is why #644 went undiagnosed for weeks. This throws InternalServerErrorException
 * instead of no-op'ing in that case (issue #649) — deliberately including unauthenticated routes
 * like /health and /readyz, since a deployment with broken RLS plumbing should fail its readiness
 * probe and stop receiving traffic rather than report healthy while every real endpoint silently
 * drops RLS.
 *
 * PrismaService is resolved lazily via ModuleRef on every request rather than constructor-injected.
 * RlsInterceptor is bound via APP_INTERCEPTOR, which Nest instantiates as part of its early
 * global-enhancer setup — before PrismaService's useFactory provider (declared in the same module)
 * is guaranteed to have run. A constructor-injected `@Optional() PrismaService` captured that
 * premature `null` permanently (RlsInterceptor is a singleton), silently disabling the RLS
 * transaction — and therefore the `app.current_user_id` GUC — for the lifetime of the process. See
 * issue #644.
 *
 * The resolution is cached after the first non-null lookup: PrismaService, once resolved, is a
 * singleton that cannot become unavailable again for the process's lifetime, so paying for a
 * `strict: false` module-graph search on every request — including unauthenticated /health and
 * /readyz probe traffic — would be pure repeated overhead.
