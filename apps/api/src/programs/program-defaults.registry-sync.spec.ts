/**
 * Forward-looking guard for the registry-drift bug class fixed on the seeding
 * side by issue #739 / PR #742. Built-in programs live in two parallel registries
 * that must be kept in sync by hand:
 *
 *   - PRESET_BASE_SPECS (packages/core/src/presets/index.ts) — the program-spec
 *     rows (leangains, rpt, 5-3-1).
 *   - PROGRAM_DEFAULTS (this directory's cycle-generation.service.ts) — the
 *     { cycleUnit, programType } metadata initializeFirstCycle needs to bootstrap
 *     cycle 1.
 *
 * A preset present in PRESET_BASE_SPECS but missing from PROGRAM_DEFAULTS cannot
 * bootstrap a cycle: initializeFirstCycle's `PROGRAM_DEFAULTS[program] ?? ...`
 * fallback only recognizes UUID custom-program ids, so a non-UUID preset id falls
 * through to BadRequestException('Unknown program') for every first-time user of
 * that program.
 *
 * The invariant is intentionally ONE-DIRECTIONAL. PROGRAM_DEFAULTS is a deliberate
 * superset — starting-strength, stronglifts, smolov, … can bootstrap a cycle with
 * no seeded spec ("degraded but safe", per the service doc comment and the
 * `programSpec.length > 0` schedule guard) — so asserting the reverse would fail on
 * those intentional spec-less entries. This mirrors the reciprocal guard for the
 * third registry (PROGRAM_LENGTHS) in packages/core/src/presets/programLengths.test.ts.
