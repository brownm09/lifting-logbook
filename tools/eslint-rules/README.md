# `@lifting-logbook/eslint-rules`

Custom ESLint rules for this monorepo. A workspace rather than inline rules in
[`eslint.config.js`](../../eslint.config.js) so each rule can carry its own
RuleTester suite without polluting the root.

## Rules

### `lifting-logbook/no-uncovered-error-fallback`

Scoped to `apps/web/app/**/*.{ts,tsx}` and `apps/api/src/**/*.ts` via
`eslint.config.js`. For every `.catch(arrow returning a neutral default)` or
`try { … } catch { redirect(…) }`, the rule requires **one** of three forms of
test coverage to be in place:

#### 1. Test-file `<path>:<line>` reference

A comment in any `*.spec.ts(x)` / `*.test.ts(x)` under `apps/web/e2e`,
`apps/web/src`, `apps/api/src`, or `packages` that names
the fallback's source location. Either a single line or a range works:

```ts
// apps/web/e2e/staging.spec.ts
test('history page renders both tabs', async ({ page }) => {
  // covers fallback at apps/web/app/history/page.tsx:37-38 — structure-only
  // assertion is acceptable because the test user has no records and the
  // fallback shape is identical to the empty success case.
  await page.goto('/history');
  await expect(page.getByRole('tab', { name: 'Lift History' })).toBeVisible();
});
```

#### 2. `// allow-skewed: <reason>` opt-out

For fallbacks with no business path to assert against (e.g., shutdown
handlers). The comment may sit immediately before the fallback or before any
ancestor expression/statement:

```ts
// allow-skewed: SIGTERM/SIGINT shutdown handler — no business path to assert against.
sdk?.shutdown().catch(() => undefined);
```

#### 3. `// fallback-covered-by: <path-to-spec-file>` pointer

For controller / service specs that exercise both branches directly, where a
`<path>:<line>` reference would be awkward. The rule verifies the named spec
file exists on disk; it does **not** verify that the spec actually exercises
both branches — that remains a reviewer responsibility (see the standard doc).

```ts
// fallback-covered-by: apps/api/src/programs/workouts.controller.spec.ts
workoutSkipOverride.getSkipsForCycle(program, dashboard.cycleNum).catch((err: unknown) => {
  console.error('[WorkoutsController] getSkipsForCycle failed; defaulting to empty set', err);
  return new Set<number>();
});
```

#### Notes and limitations

- **Ancestor-comment blast radius.** When a comment sits above an ancestor of the
  fallback (e.g., above the enclosing `const [...] = await Promise.all([...])`),
  it opts out **every** `.catch()` inside that statement. To annotate granularly,
  place the comment immediately before the specific `.catch()`.
- **Cache behavior.** The reference set is built once per ESLint process. This is
  correct for `npm run lint` but means IDE / `--fix --watch` workflows will not
  pick up newly-added test comments until the editor language-server restarts.
- **What counts as "neutral default".** `Literal`, `ArrayExpression`,
  `ObjectExpression`, any `Identifier`, and any TS type-assertion wrapping one of
  the above. `NewExpression` (e.g., `new Set()`) is intentionally **not**
  matched today — see the standard doc for current scope.
- **Aliased `redirect` imports** (`import { redirect as nextRedirect }`) are
  not detected. Bare `redirect(...)` and `something.redirect(...)` are.

### `lifting-logbook/require-fetch-cache`

Scoped to `apps/web/**/*.{ts,tsx}` (spec/test files ignored) via
[`eslint.config.js`](../../eslint.config.js). Next.js reversed the default
`fetch()` caching behaviour between v14 and v15, so relying on the default is a
latent correctness bug (see
[`docs/standards/fetch-cache-semantics.md`](../../docs/standards/fetch-cache-semantics.md)).
This rule requires every `fetch()` call to carry an explicit cache directive.

It flags:

- **Zero/one-argument calls** — `fetch(url)` (no options object at all).
- **Two-argument calls whose options object literal omits both `cache` and
  `next`** — e.g. `fetch(url, { method: 'POST' })`. This is the gap the previous
  `no-restricted-syntax` selector (which matched only single-argument calls)
  could not catch.

Deliberate non-flags (cannot be verified statically, so left to code review):

- **Options object containing a spread** (`fetch(url, { ...init })`) — the spread
  may carry `cache`/`next` at runtime, as in the `apiFetch` / `clientFetch`
  wrappers.
- **Second argument that is not an object literal** (`fetch(url, init)`) — a
  variable or call expression is not statically inspectable. A TS type assertion
  (`{ next: { revalidate: 60 } } as RequestInit`) **is** unwrapped to the object
  literal underneath and inspected.

> **Lint scope.** The web workspace lint script is `eslint app lib`, so this rule
> runs against both `apps/web/app` and `apps/web/lib` in CI. (`lib/` coverage was
> added in [#473](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/473) — before
> that the script was `eslint app` and `lib/` fetch sites were unguarded.)

### `lifting-logbook/no-raw-fetch-outside-api-client`

Scoped to `apps/web/**/*.{ts,tsx}` (spec/test files ignored) via
[`eslint.config.js`](../../eslint.config.js). #466/#479 consolidated all web HTTP
access into [`packages/api-client`](../../packages/api-client)'s
`createApiClient({ baseUrl, getAuthHeaders })`, which owns the
`X-Clerk-Authorization` (server, Cloud Run IAM) vs `Authorization` (browser) split
and merges auth headers with auth-wins precedence. This rule (flag 6 of the
2026-06-08 architecture review, [#464](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/464)
/ [#494](https://github.com/brownm09/lifting-logbook/issues/494)) prevents a raw
`fetch()` to the API — written the "obvious" way — from bypassing the client and
403-ing behind Cloud Run IAM.

It flags:

- **Bare `fetch(...)` calls** — `fetch(url, …)` (not `something.fetch(…)`). API
  calls must go through the typed client.
- **Hand-built auth headers** — an object literal with a static property keyed
  `Authorization` or `X-Clerk-Authorization` (compared case-insensitively). These
  headers are owned by the api-client; constructing them elsewhere is the footgun.

Allowlisted files (checked by filename inside the rule, not via `eslint.config.js`):

- `apps/web/lib/api.ts` and `apps/web/lib/client-api.ts` — the two
  `createApiClient()` wrapper modules that legitimately set auth headers.
- `apps/web/lib/gcp-identity-token.ts` — fetches the **GCP metadata server** (not
  the API) and builds a `Metadata-Flavor` header, not an auth header.

`packages/api-client` is outside the `apps/web` lint scope, so the `fetch()` inside
`createApiClient()` is never seen by this rule.

### `lifting-logbook/no-direct-prisma-transaction`

Scoped to `apps/api/src/adapters/prisma/**/*.ts` (spec/test files ignored) via
[`eslint.config.js`](../../eslint.config.js). The RLS interceptor
(`rls.interceptor.ts`) owns the one per-request interactive transaction, and
`rls-context.service.ts` owns short-lived per-operation transactions for
`@SkipRlsTransaction()` handlers. A raw `.$transaction()` call anywhere else
would either bypass the RLS `app.current_user_id` GUC setup (silently returning
all rows to the app role) or attempt an illegal nested transaction on an
interactive-transaction client.

Callers that need transactional behaviour must use `runBatch` or `runInteractive`
from [`prisma-tx.util.ts`](../../apps/api/src/adapters/prisma/prisma-tx.util.ts).

Allowlisted files (checked by filename suffix inside the rule):

- `apps/api/src/adapters/prisma/prisma-tx.util.ts` — the utility that wraps `$transaction` for all callers
- `apps/api/src/adapters/prisma/rls.interceptor.ts` — owns the per-request interactive transaction
- `apps/api/src/adapters/prisma/rls-context.service.ts` — owns the per-operation short-lived transaction for `@SkipRlsTransaction()` handlers (#518)

## Adding a new rule

1. Write `tools/eslint-rules/my-new-rule.js` exporting an ESLint rule module
   (with `meta`, `create`).
2. Register it in [`index.js`](./index.js):

   ```js
   const myNewRule = require('./my-new-rule');
   module.exports = {
     rules: {
       'no-uncovered-error-fallback': require('./no-uncovered-error-fallback'),
       'my-new-rule': myNewRule,
     },
   };
   ```

3. Wire it into [`../../eslint.config.js`](../../eslint.config.js) — add it
   to the existing `lifting-logbook` plugin block, scoped via `files` to the
   directories where it should apply.
4. Add a RuleTester suite alongside the rule
   (`tools/eslint-rules/my-new-rule.test.js`) and register the test file in
   the [`package.json`](./package.json) `test` script.
5. Document the rule in this README under `## Rules`.

## Running the tests

```bash
npm test -w @lifting-logbook/eslint-rules
```

The suite uses Node's built-in `node:test` runner plus ESLint's `RuleTester`,
with `@typescript-eslint/parser` for TS source. Each test case builds a
disposable sandbox under `os.tmpdir()` so the rule's module-level cache cannot
leak between cases.
